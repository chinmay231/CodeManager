# 🧠 CodeManager — Automated Code Knowledge Base for AI and Developers V2.0

CodeManager V2 is a **polished, dark-themed Streamlit app** that helps you maintain a **live, AI-ready knowledge base** of your code. It watches folders or **tracks specific files you select via drag‑and‑drop**, regenerates:
- **`CODEFILE.txt`** (concatenated code with headers)
- **`StructureLatest.md`** (Markdown folder tree)

…and optionally serves them via Apache2 for use in **RAG** pipelines or as team-facing documentation.

> V2 focuses on UX: drag-and-drop file tracking, a manifest, dark theme, cleaner layout, and clearer controls. V1 instructions are kept below for continuity.
